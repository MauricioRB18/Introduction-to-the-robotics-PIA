    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that integrates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to design, build, and program robots. Through hands-on experience, students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills that are increasingly valuable in today’s technology-driven world.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Stage 1: Programming applied to robotics</h2>
    <p>
      The BullBot is a robotic prototype designed to help students develop programming and robotics skills by understanding logical sequences and controlling robot movements using Rogic software. It includes sensors and actuators, allowing users to interact with the robot through a wired or Bluetooth connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this experience, students apply STEM knowledge while improving their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Programming involves creating step-by-step instructions, written in a specific syntax, to control a computer or robot. It promotes logical reasoning, creativity, and the ability to plan, test, and improve solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning programming is now essential, as it is used in many fields like AI, robotics, and communications. The BullBot surveillance flowchart shows a repeated sequence of actions that the robot performs four times: moving forward three times, turning on the LED, waiting, turning off the LED, and then turning right.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process is programmed using Rogic, a block-based language that simplifies algorithm translation and logic implementation. Key steps include selecting the right language, translating the algorithm into code, and implementing the logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables are essential in robot programming for controlling behavior and storing data. They include integers, floating points, booleans, characters, and strings — each used for different types of data and operations.

    <h2>Stage 2: Sequential Programming Structures</h2>
    <p>
      In Stage 2, the main topic was sequential programming structures, a fundamental concept in robotics. This type of structure involves executing instructions in a specific order, which is essential for controlling a robot’s behavior accurately and predictably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sequential programming ensures that a robot performs tasks step by step, responding to commands in the exact sequence in which they are written. This structure is the foundation for more complex programming logic, such as loops and conditionals, and is crucial for developing reliable and efficient robotic systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding sequential programming also allows for better planning and debugging of a robot's actions, making it a key building block in robotics education.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Stage 3: Cyclic programming Structures</h2>
    <p>
      In Stage 3, two types of programming structures were discussed: the <strong>while loop</strong> and the <strong>loop (for loop)</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>While Loop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Used when the number of repetitions is unknown and depends on a condition.</li>
      <li>Runs as long as the condition is true.</li>
      <li>Ideal when the number of iterations depends on a dynamically changing condition.</li>
      <li>Example: Keep asking a user until they provide a valid answer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Loop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Used when the number of repetitions is known in advance.</li>
      <li>Runs a set number of times, typically using a counter variable.</li>
      <li>Ideal for tasks that need to be repeated a specific number of times.</li>
      <li>Example: Make a robot move forward 10 steps.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Stage 4: Nanomedicine and Conditional Programming</h2>
    <p>
      In recent years, <strong>nanomedicine</strong> — the application of nanotechnology to health sciences — has become one of the most emerging areas in medicine. Nanomedicine aims to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases through innovations such as <strong>nanorobots</strong> programmed to detect the presence of a pathology or to deliver drugs directly to affected tissues.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the integrated product of the learning unit of Introduction to Robotics, students are invited to program an <strong>autonomous robot</strong> that helps solve a problem related to an aspect of biology in health. This will be developed step-by-step throughout each of the stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stage introduces <strong>conditional programming structures</strong>, which allow the normal sequence of steps to be altered in order to create two alternative execution blocks — only one of which will be executed based on a condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a condition is evaluated, the program decides which path to follow: true or false. Complex conditions can be built using rational and logical operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      This structure is represented as a decision point in the program’s flow. Depending on the evaluation, specific tasks are executed within each branch, allowing robots to make intelligent decisions during operation.
    </p>
